**📘 QuoteVault – Mobile Application**
**🔧 Setup Instructions**

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

Run flutter pub get to install dependencies.

Create a Supabase project.

Configure Supabase credentials in the app:

Add Supabase URL and Anon Public Key in the initialization file.

Enable Email/Password authentication in Supabase.

(For development) Disable email confirmation in Supabase Auth settings.

Run the app using flutter run.

**🤖 AI Coding Approach & Workflow**

The development followed an AI-assisted, design-first workflow:

UI designs were generated first using AI design tools.

Screens and UX were finalized before writing code to avoid rework.

AI assistance was used iteratively for:

UI component generation

Flutter best practices

Supabase integration

Debugging authentication and database issues

Logic and state management were refined step-by-step to align with functional requirements.

This ensured clean architecture, faster development, and reduced errors.

**🛠️ AI Tools Used**

ChatGPT – UI logic, Flutter code, Supabase backend logic, debugging

Stitch (Google AI) – AI-generated UI designs

**🎨 Design Links**

**⚠️ Known Limitations / Incomplete Features**

Collections feature is partially implemented.

Push notifications are planned but not enabled.

Language localization is not yet implemented.

Some animations and micro-interactions can be further refined.

**✅ Summary**

QuoteVault demonstrates a modern AI-assisted mobile app development workflow, integrating Flutter, Supabase, and AI-generated UI design with secure authentication and clean architecture.
